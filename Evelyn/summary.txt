This Python code implements a simple voice-activated personal assistant named Zira using the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries.  Zira listens for user voice input, converts it to text, and responds with predefined answers based on a question-answer dictionary. If the question is not in the dictionary, it provides a default response. The assistant also handles speech recognition errors and includes an exit command.
